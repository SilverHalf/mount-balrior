# Legendary Ura Mechanical Reference
{: .no_toc}

From a mechanical point of view, Legendary Ura is relatively similar to the normal Challenge Mode. This page summarizes all differences between the two modes, but for more information on individual skills and attacks it is recommended to read the [Challenge Mode Mechanical Reference](../ura/mechanics.html).

## Health and Phases

Legendary Ura has 30% more maximum health than in Challenge Mode. Furthermore, in the transition from the third to the final phase, she will heal by 30% of her health instead of 15%, meaning her overall total HP is over 137 million. This is 46 million more than in Challenge Mode! For reference, [Dhuum Challenge Mode](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hall_of_Chains#The_Voice_in_) has 40 million HP. This means that the damage check is extremely tight.

Apart from this, Ura LCM keeps the same 4-phase structure of CM, with the same skills and transitions.

Throughout the fight, Ura's <img class='inline defiance'> [Defiance Bar] will constantly regenrate 150 HP every second.

## Mechanics

Most of Ura LCM's mechanics are very similar to the ones in CM. Below you will find a compiled list of differences between the normal and LCM mechanics, if any exist.

### Toxic Geysers
See also: [Mechanical Reference](../ura/mechanics.html#toxic-geysers)

Toxic Geysers in LCM behave similarly to CM, but with a few fundamental differences:
- Geysers' <img class='inline defiance'> [Defiance Bar] has 1000 HP instead of 800 HP.
- Geysers' <img class='inline defiance'> [Defiance Bar] regenerates 150 HP per second.
- Geysers will spawn every 12 seconds for the entire fight.

### Titanspawn Geysers
See also: [Mechanical Reference](../ura/mechanics.html#titanspawn-geysers)

Titanspawners have one major difference in LCM: starting from phase 4, they will no longer spawn [Champion Fumarollers], instead spawning [Legendary Ventshots]. These are extremely dangerous mobs: with over 20 million HP, they cannot be killed while meeting the damage check, and instead must be managed by upkeeping permanent <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] and projectile reflection.
