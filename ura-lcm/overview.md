Legendary Godscream Ura is an extreme challenge aimed at the highest tier of players. Beating her encounter requires perfect knowledge of the fight and of your class, and smooth execution of your chosen strategy.

Legendary Mode is mechanically similar to Challenge Mode, requirign good healing and condition cleanse, very good <img class="inline stability"> [Stability](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stability) uptime (especially through the final phase), and a greater amount of crowd control than any other encounter in the game.

Squads attempting Ura will generally run an optimized composition, where every player will have their role in managing one or more of the boss's mechanics.
