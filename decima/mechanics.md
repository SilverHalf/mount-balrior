## Overview

Decima's basic behaviour is centered around an attack loop: a series of skills that constantly repeat until the boss progresses to the next phase by being lowered to determined health thresholds. This means that the encounter is relatively scripted; since the sequence is known, the squad can always predict and prepare for oncoming mechanics. The sequence varies phase by phase, but has the following structure:

Proximity to the boss determines the targets for the primary mechanics, [Chorus of Thunder] and [Fluxlances]. With proper positioning, these mechanics can be assigned to the same players for each occurrence, making the fight easier for the group as a whole. 

Several of Decima's attacks hit hard, requiring proper healing and damage mitigation management. <img class="inline stability"> [Stability] is also required for both groups at differing times throughout the fight.

Misplaying mechanics usually results in the boss acquiring <img class="inline charge"> [Charge] stacks. This can be dangerous since the boss's damage scales with the number of stacks, additionally upon gaining 10 stacks the boss enrages,killing the entire group . However, Decima resets her <img class="inline charge"> [Charge] level twice, at 70%, 40% of her HP, and as a result the encounter is relatively forgiving.

#### Interaction Graph
{: .no_toc}
Decima can be a difficult boss to understand fully, as each of her unique mechanics has its own particular interactions with the rest of the encounter. For convenience's sake, below you will find a simplified graph with the most important interactions.

## Phases
Decima's encounter has an articulate structure, with over nine unique sub-phases. We can roughly divide these into four distinct parts, based on health percentage.

---

### First Phase

#### 100% - 80%
{: .no_toc}
Decima starts the fight in the center of the arena.
As soon as the encounter begins, she summons her [Conduits], then begins doing the following attack loop:

{: .center}

Decima's [Conduits] in this phase form a star shape, and maintain this shape, only slightly shifting inwards and outwards as the phase progresses. [Fulgent Fences] will be active during both [Fluxlance Salvo] attacks, and during [Seismic Crash] and [Earthrend]. The second [Fluxlance Salvo], and every other salvo afterwards, will have a [Red Fluxlance] targeting the furthest player.

#### 80% - 70%
{: .no_toc}

As soon as Decima reaches 80% of her HP, she will finish whatever animation she is doing, then transition into the following phase. The transition consists of these steps:
1. All [Fulgent Fences] and [Dancing Sparks] currently on the arena will despawn.
2. All [Conduits] rearrange into a new pattern, made of three hexagonal formations (see the video below). Meanwhile, Decima uses [Seismic Reposition] to move inside of one of these hexagons.
3. [Fulgent Fences] reactivate, sealing off the formation, and a [Transcendent Boulder] spawns inside each of the two remaining unoccupied hexagons.

<video class="center" width="50%" controls muted>
  <source src="../videos/decima_conduits_1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

{: .note}
Decima will always move to the formation consisting of the [Conduits] that were formerly on the outermost ring (colored in blue in the video above).

As soon as Decima is done repositioning, she continues with the same attack loop as in the previous phase, except all attacks will originate from her <b>new position</b>.

Both Decima and [Transcendent Boulders] will gain <img class="inline linked"> [Linked]. This means that the boulders must be killed within 10 seconds of each other. Decima herself, while still vulnerable, will not transition into the following phase until they are dead.

At the beginning of the phase, an updraft will spawn in the center of the arena, allowing players to jump up and glide into the hexagonal formations after they are locked down with [Fulgent Fences]. Similar updrafts will spawn on each [Transcendent Boulder]'s death, allowing players to exit and return to the boss at the end of the split phase.

Both [Transcendent Boulders] will start casting [Sparkling Reverberation], unlocking their <img class="inline defiance"> [Defiance Bar]. After this attack ends, either by completing the channel or the squad breaking the defiance bar, they will start chain casting [Seismoelectricity] until they reach 1% health (see <img class="inline linked"> [Linked]) or die.

#### 70% Transition
{: .no_toc}
Once Decima reaches 70% of her health and both [Transcendent Boulders] are dead, she performs a sequence that transitions her into the second phase:
1. Decima gains <img class="inline nova-shield"> [Nova Shield].
2. Decima will [Seismic Reposition] to the center of the arena.
3. Decima starts channeling her [Flux Nova], unlocking her <img class="inline defiance"> [Defiance Bar], and simultaneously casts [Chorus of Thunder].
4. Upon finishing her channel, or shortly after her defiance is broken, Decima will [Fulminate] all charged [Conduits], then consume all her <img class="inline charge"> [Charge] to conclude her [Flux Nova].

---

### Second Phase
If Decima's <img class="inline defiance"> [Defiance Bar] was broken during [Flux Nova], she will start the phase with 10 seconds of <img class='inline stun'> [Stunned] and <img class="inline exposed"> [Exposed].  This phase is structured similarly to the previous one, with two burn phases divided by a split phase at 50% HP. 
The major difference here is two fold: conduit movements are markedly different from the first phase and the 50% split phase is significantly more dangerous. Combined, these often prove to be a major hurdle for progression.


#### 70% - 50%
{: .no_toc}

In this burn phase, Decima performs the following attack loop:

This loop is, in essence, identical to its behaviour in the previous phase, but substitutes [Fluxlance Fusillade] for the more dangerous [Fluxlance Salvo]. On the second and every other [Fluxlance Salvo] thereafter, one of the fluxlances will be a [Red Fluxlance].

Conduit movements in this phase are shown in the following short video, where each corner of the colored shapes is a conduit.

<video class="center" width="50%" controls muted>
  <source src="../videos/decima_conduits_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

#### 50% - 40% and Transition
This phase is essentially identical to the [80% -70% Phase](#80---70), with one major difference: once their <img class="inline defiance"> [Defiance Bar] is broken, [Transcendent Boulders] will start periodically casting [Sparkwave](#sparkwave). This is an extremely dangerous skill, both it and the [Charged Ground] it generates must be avoided or managed with extreme care.

Once Decima reaches 40% of her health and both [Transcendent Boulders] are dead, she will perform the same sequence she used at [70%](#70-transition) to transition into the third phase.

---

### Third Phase
This phase consists of one large burn from 40% to 10% of Decima's HP. It differs significatively from the previous phases, as Decima will often make use of her [Seismic Reposition] to move around the arena. This also introduces two new attacks: [Focused Fluxlance] and [Converging Fluxlances].

At the beginning of the phase, Decima will summon two [Transcendent Boulders]. These are untargetable and cannot be interacted with. They do not <img class="inline linked"> [Link] with the boss, and do not cast any skills except for participating in [Converging Fluxlances]. Decima will then [Seismic Reposition] and begin the following attack loop:

Every time Decima casts [Seismic Reposition] in this phase, she will relocate to a random position located on a circle 1500 units from the center of the arena. Furthermore, all her conduits will move to this new position, reconfiguring as shown in the following clip:

<video class="center" width="50%" controls muted>
  <source src="../videos/decima_conduits_3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

### Final Phase
On reaching 10% health, Decima will become <img class="inline invuln"> [Invulnerable], then [Seismic Reposition] to the center of the arena. She will simultaneously cast [Discordant Thunder] targeting all ten players, then cast [Harmonious Thunder]. Shortly after jumping, all [Conduits] will lose their charge.

Once at the center, the squad will have some time to damage her while she does the following sequence of attacks:
1. [Chorus of Thunder] twice, once with a single target per type and once with three targets per type.
2. [Fulgent Fences].
3. [Fluxlance Salvo], with one fluxlance being a [Red Fluxlance].

Once this sequence is complete, Decima will start rapidly gaining <img class="inline harmony"> [Peal of Harmony] and <img class="inline discord"> [Peal of Discord] while chain-casting [Chorus of Thunder]. This results in all [Conduits] quickly being charged. Sometimes conduits will double charge, as they will be targeted by a new [Chorus of Thunder] during a previous cast. 

Throughout this, conduits will sporadically spawn [Dancing Sparks]. Then, once all conduits are charged, every conduit will start simultaneously spawning [Dancing Sparks]. This, combined with continuous [Discordant Thunder] casts, will rapidly lead to defeat unless the boss is killed.

#### Peals Gained
{: .no_toc}
The sequence in which Decima gains <img class="inline harmony"> [Peal of Harmony] and <img class="inline discord"> [Peal of Discord] throughout the final phase is deterministic, though hard to keep track of. She wll gain:
- +1 <img class="inline harmony"> [Peal of Harmony] at 7, 4 and 1% HP.
- +1 of both peals at 3, 5, 7 and 9 seconds after the start of the phase. On the first and last of this set, these will be used instantly to cast [Chorus of Thunder]. Sometimes the first one will not increase the targeted [Conduit]'s charge.
- +3 of both peals at 21 seconds after the start of the phase, instantly used by [Chorus of Thunder].
- +4 of both peals at 23 seconds. <img class="inline harmony"> [Peal of Harmony] will instantly be used by [Harmonious Thunder].
- +4 of both peals at 25 seconds.
- +5 of both peals at 29 seconds and every 2 seconds after. These cannot take Decima above 10 stacks so the third and onwards often will have no effect.

## List of Mechanics
This section contains a full, in-depth explanation of all mechanics in the encounter.

---

### Thrumming Presence
{: .no_toc}
A 750-radius area-of-effect centered around Decima, outlined with a faint red circle. Constantly inflicts a small amount of damage to all players inside the area and applies <img class="inline harmonic-sensitivity"> [Harmonic Sensitivity].

<img class="center" width="80%" src="../images/decima/mechanics/thrumming.webp" />

Decima gains her Thrumming Presence at the beginning of the encounter only losing it: while casting [Seismic Reposition], when she has <img class="inline nova-shield"> [Nova Shield], while <img class="inline stun"> [Stunned], and when she is under 10% health.

---

### Fluxlances
{: .no_toc}
Also known as *"Arrows"* due to their indicator; Laser attacks originating from the boss. Once their indicator appears, after a brief delay, fluxlances will fire, applying an effect in a line according to their type. Fluxlances have infinite range, but can be blocked by [Conduits]. Any conduit hit by a lance will increase its charge level, but will prevent the lance from extending beyond the conduit itself. Fluxlances cannot be <img class="inline aegis"> [Blocked] or <img class="inline evade"> [Evaded], and ignore <img class="inline invuln"> [Invulnerability].

#### Standard Fluxlance
{: .no_toc}
Also known as *Orange Arrow*. Targets the furthest player that is not targeted by another Fluxlance, dealing heavy damage to all allies, increased for players affected by <img class="inline harmonic-sensitivity"> [Harmonic Sensitivity], and applying 30 seconds of <img class="inline galvanic-sensitivity"> [Galvanic Sensitivity]. Additionally applies a stack of <img class="inline exposed"> [Exposed] to all allies hit except its target.

#### Red Fluxlance
{: .no_toc}
Also known as *Red Arrow*. Always targets the furthest player, and <img class="inline defeat"> [Defeats] all allies it hits. <b>Must</b> be aimed away from the squad and blocked using a [Conduit].

#### Focused Fluxlance
{: .no_toc}
Also known as *Green Arrow*. Targets the furthest conduit from the furthest player from the boss (i.e. opposite side of the boss from *Red Arrow*). Requires five people to be inside the arrow's line of fire to block the attack and prevent it from charging the conduit. Deals heavy damage, reduced based on the number of people in the arrow, and unaffected by <img class="inline harmonic-sensitivity"> [Harmonic Sensitivity]. Focused Fluxlances are summoned as part of Decima's attack rotation from 40% to 10% HP.

<img class="center" width="80%" src="../images/decima/mechanics/fluxlances.webp" />

Standard or red fluxlances are summoned whenever Decima casts one of the following skills as part of her attack loop:

#### Fluxlance Fusillade
{: .no_toc}
Targets the five furthest players with standard fluxlances. Targeted players will have a number above their head from one to five. After a brief delay the lances will be fired in sequence based on their number. Every other time that Decima uses this skill, one of the fluxlances will be a red fluxlance.

#### Fluxlance Salvo
{: .no_toc}
Targets the five furthest players with fluxlances. After a brief delay, all lances are fired simultaneously. Every other time that Decima uses this skill, one of the fluxlances will be a red fluxlance.

#### Converging Fluxlances
{: .no_toc}

{: .note}
This skill does not have an official name, so this name is given for convenience.

A combined attack performed by Decima and two [Transcendent Boulders]. This attack consists of:
- One [Red Fluxlance] cast by Decima and targeting the furthest player from her.
- Two [Standard Fluxlances] cast by Decima and targeting the next two furthest players.
- One [Standard Fluxlance] cast by each [Transcendent Boulder] and targeting the furthest player from Decima.

Therefore, while five fluxlances are summoned in total similarly to previous attacks, three of them (one red and two standard) will be targeting the same player.

---

### Chorus of Thunder
{: .no_toc}
This attack has two components:

#### Harmonious Thunder
{: .no_toc}
Decima consumes all stacks of <img class="inline harmony"> [Peal of Harmony]. For each stack, she targets the closest uncharged, untargeted [Conduit] to the furthest player with Thunder.

#### Discordant Thunder
{: .no_toc}
Decima consumes all stacks of <img class="inline discord"> [Peal of Discord]. For each stack, she targets the closest untargeted player with Thunder.

Thunders are player-centred tracking AoEs that fill and explode after a brief delay, dealing damage and charging all [Conduits] they hit. Damage increases with the number of overlapping AoEs, but can be <img class="inline evade"> [Evaded], <img class="inline aegis"> [Blocked], or avoided with <img class="inline invuln"> [Invulnerability] . Single blocks will prevent one Thunder from hitting, but channeled blocks are necessary in case of multiple overlaps.

Players hit by any Thunder except their own will gain a stack of <img class="inline exposed"> [Exposed].

Chorus of Thunder is used regularly by Decima as part of her attack loop.

---

### Conduits
{: .no_toc}
Conduits, or pylons, are structures that are manipulated by Decima and play a critical part in the encounter as a whole. Eighteen of them are summoned at the beginning of the fight and they persist throughout all phases. Conduits are arrayed in shifting patterns around Decima, which vary based on the phase and the state of Decima's attack loop.

<img src="../images/decima/mechanics/conduits.webp">

#### Conduit Charge
{: .no_toc}
Whenever a conduit is hit by by [Fluxlances] or [Thunder], it gains a level of *Charge*. When charged a conduit gains *Fulgent Aura*: a red damaging AoE centered around the conduit that grows larger with each level of charge. Conduits cannot be charged more than three times: every time a level three conduit would gain a charge, it will instead [Fulminate]. Conduits lose all charge after the boss casts [Flux Nova], and when the boss transitions into the final phase of the fight.

#### Fulminate
{: .no_toc}
A charged conduit explodes, dealing damage based on its charge level in a large area. Level three conduits additionally apply a stack of <img class="inline exposed"> [Exposed], and grant Decima five stacks each of <img class="inline harmony"> [Peal of Harmony] and <img class="inline discord"> [Peal of Discord]. Level three conduits will Fulminate whenever they would gain a charge, and all conduits Fulminate as part of [Flux Nova], during the transitions at 70% and 40% of Decima's health. 

#### Fulgent Fences
{: .no_toc}
Lasers periodically link all conduits together in a pattern. Whenever any player passes through them, they are affected by *Reverberating Impact*, which deals moderate damage and pushes the player out of the laser, preventing them from crossing it. This is also applied for movement skills such as dashes, but excludes player teleportation such as blinks or portals. It is not affected by <img class="inline stability"> [Stability]. Players that are knocked into a fence by Decima's attacks are ejected at high speeds, possibly into other fences.

#### Dancing Sparks
{: .no_toc}
Also known as *greens*. Small AoEs that spawn from charged [Conduits] and start moving towards Decima. If they are allowed to reach the boss, they are consumed and grant her a stack of <img class="inline charge"> [Charge].

Sparks deal damage to all players standing in their area, which is greatly increased towards players affected by <img class="inline galvanic-sensitivity"> [Galvanic Sensitivity]. When enough players stand inside a spark, it will stop moving towards Decima and start draining health, disappearing once fully drained. The number of players required to achieve this effect is displayed above each spark, and is equal to the charge level of its originating conduit.

All charged conduits spawn sparks simultaneously as part of Decima's attack loop.

### Foreshock & Mainshock
{: .no_toc}
<img class="center" width="100%" src="../images/decima/mechanics/mainshock.webp" />

#### Foreshock
{: .no_toc}
Decima stomps three times, dealing moderate damage in 3 large AoEs.

#### Mainshock
{: .no_toc}
Always cast after Foreshock:  a "pizza" attack centered on Decima. Deals significant damage and additionally inflicts 1.5 seconds of <img class="inline cripple"> [Cripple]. Players hit by multiple "slices" will receive multiple instances of this damage.

Foreshock and Mainshock are used regularly by Decima as part of her attack loop, and are always directed towards the closest player.

---

### Seismic Crash
{: .no_toc}
Decima leaps up, then crashes down in a circular AoE centered on herself. This AoE has two components:
- An inner circle, with the same dimensions as Decima's hitbox, that <img class="inline defeat"> [Defeats] all players inside of it. This effect cannot be <img class="inline evade"> [Evaded] or <img class="inline aegis"> [Blocked], and is not affected by <img class="inline invuln"> [Invulnerability].
- A larger circle centered on the hitbox deals damage (decreasing the further the player) and inflicts <img class="inline knockback"> [Knockback], launching players away from the boss. This part can be mitigated using all standard methods.

Seismic Crash is a critical ability, not due to its instant kill potential, but mainly because the <img class="inline knockback"> [Knockback] is especially dangerous when combined with [Chorus of Thunder], [Fluxlances] and [Fulgent Fences].

Decima casts this skill regularly as part of her attack loop. Furthermore, she also casts this skill as part of her <b>Seismic Reposition</b>, which is essentially identical but also has a movement component.

---

### Earthrend
{: .no_toc}
Decima leaps up, then crashes down, generating AoE attacks in two components:
- An inner circle, corresponding with Decima's hitbox, that <img class="inline defeat"> [Defeats] all players inside of it. This effect cannot be <img class="inline evade"> [Evaded] or <img class="inline aegis"> [Blocked], and is not affected by <img class="inline invuln"> [Invulnerability].
- A wide ring on the outside of the arena deals damage and inflicts <img class="inline knockback"> [Knockback], launching players towards the boss. This part can be mitigated using all standard methods.

While similar to [Seismic Crash], this skill is much less threatening since it usually does not affect the area where the squad is stacking. Decima casts this skill regularly as part of her attack loop.

---

### Flux Nova
{: .no_toc}
A massive arena-wide attack. This attack has two versions: a first one is used as part of the phase transitions at 70% and 40% of Decima's health total, while the second one is used whenever she reaches 10 stacks of <img class="inline charge"> [Charge], or when the enrage timer runs out.

#### Transition Nova
{: .no_toc}
Upon reaching 70% or 40% health, Decima gains <img class="inline nova-shield"> [Nova Shield], then casts [Seismic Reposition] to the center of the arena, followed by [Chorus of Thunder]. She will then start channeling her main attack, gaining a large <img class="inline defiance"> [Defiance Bar]. During the channel, all charged [Conduits] will start summoning [Dancing Sparks]: if these are allowed to reach Decima, they will fully regenerate her <img class="inline defiance"> [Defiance] in addition to their other effects. Breaking this bar will shorten the channel (possibly despawning all [Dancing Sparks]) and apply <img class="inline fractured"> [Fractured Armor] to her.

When the channel ends: Decima will first [Fulminate] all conduits, and then cast her main attack, consuming all stacks of <img class="inline charge"> [Charge] to deal massive squad-wide damage. If she is affected by <img class="inline fractured"> [Fractured Armor]: she will take backlash from her attack, <img class='inline stun'> [Stunning] her for 10 seconds and applying <img class="inline exposed"> [Exposed] for the same duration.

#### Death Nova
{: .no_toc}
If Decima gains 10 stacks of <img class="inline charge"> [Charge] or the *enrage timer* runs out, Decima will stop whatever attack she was doing, gain <img class="inline nova-shield"> [Nova Shield], and then cast a maximum power Nova after a short channel, <img class="inline defeat"> [Defeating] all players.

---

### Transcendent Boulders
{: .no_toc}
Dangerous minions that spawn during the split phases at 70% and 50% of Decima's HP, and at the beginning of the third phase.

| **Health** | 1,533,636 	 |
| **Armor** |  2597 (standard) |
| **Hitbox** | 380 |
| **Defiance** | 1000 |

There will always be two of them alive at the same time; since they gain <img class="inline linked"> [Linked], they must be killed within 10 seconds of each other.

Players who attack [Transcendent Boulders] from more than 750 range will be teleported to the boulder and gain a stack of <img class="inline debilitated"> [Debilitated].

Boulders can use several different attacks:

#### Sparking Reverberation
{: .no_toc}
The boulder smashes the ground continuously, for a cast time of 19.75 seconds, dealing damage to all enemies and unlocking its <img class="inline defiance"> [Defiance Bar]. If the skill is allowed to complete: it will apply 60 seconds of <img class="inline debilitated"> [Debilitated] to the entire squad. Breaking the <img class="inline defiance"> [Defiance Bar] will interrupt this skill, <img class='inline stun'> [Stunning] the boulder for 5 seconds and applying 10 seconds of <img class="inline exposed"> [Exposed].

#### Seismoelectricity
{: .no_toc}
The boulder jumps into the air and then crashes down: releasing six arcs of electricity that spread out in a hexagonal shape, before returning to the add. These arcs will deal damage and remove boons from players they hit and can be jumped or blocked.

#### Sparkwave
{: .no_toc}
Targets the fifth-furthest player from the boulder with a massive, 120° wide arc of lightning. Players hit by this wave will take damage and generate [Charged Ground] below them. This skill is extremely dangerous, so whenever the boulder's <img class='inline defiance'> [Defiance Bar] is broken, a player (usually the healer) should try to bait it away from their teammates, including the subgroup fighting the other boulder, as the attack is arena-wide. 

#### Charged Ground
{: .no_toc}

A circular damaging AoE that increases its damage over time, and applies <img class="inline daze"> [Daze](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Daze) and <img class="inline vuln"> [Vulnerability] on reaching maximum damage. Players who are hit by this skill will also generate an additional AoE below them, if they haven't already, resulting in a fast spread of the damaging area.

---

### <img class="inline fractured"> Fractured Armor
{: .no_toc}
An effect that is gained by Decima whenever her defiance bar is broken. Makes Decima susceptible to the backlash from her next [Flux Nova],  which <img class='inline stun'> [Stuns] her for 10 seconds and applies <img class="inline exposed"> [Exposed] for the same duration. 

---

### <img class="inline linked"> Linked
{: .no_toc}
This effect has two versions: one that is applied to Decima at the beginning of the 80% and 50% split phases, and one that is applied to [Transcendent Boulders].

#### Decima
{: .no_toc}
Decima links herself to a [Transcendent Boulder], becoming <img class="inline invuln"> [Invulnerable] for as long as the boulder remains alive. Since there are always two boulders, Decima will gain two of this effect.

#### Boulders
{: .no_toc}
The two [Transcendent Boulders] link to each other and gain this effect. Whenever one of the two falls to 1% HP, it becomes <img class="inline invuln"> [Invulnerable], and after 10 seconds, it will heal itself back to 50% of its maximum health. If, during this interval, its linked target also falls to 1% health, the <img class="inline invuln"> [Invulnerability] is removed and both boulders can be killed.
