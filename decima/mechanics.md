## Attacks

These are mechanics originating from Decima herself.

### Thrumming Presence

A 750-radius area-of-effect centered around Decima, outlined with a faint red circle. Constantly inflicts a small amount of damage to all players inside the area (increasing with the number of <img class="inline charge"> [Charge] on the boss) and applying <img class="inline harmonic-sensitivity"> [Harmonic Sensitivity].

Decima gains her Thrumming Presence at the beginning of the encounter, and only loses it while moving, while casting [Flux Nova](), while <img class="inline stun"> [Stunned], and under 10% health.

### Fluxlances

Line attacks originating from the boss, also commonly called "Arrows". Fluxlances have infinite range and track players, but can be blocked by [Conduits](). Any conduit hit by a lance will gain a level of <img class="inline charge"> [Charge], but will prevent the lance from extending beyond the conduit itself. Lances are <img class="inline unblockable"> [Unblockable] and come in two varieties:

- **Standard Fluxlance** - also known as "orange arrow". Deals heavy damage and applies 30 seconds of <img class="inline galvanic-sensitivity"> [Galvanic Sensitivity] to all players hit. Players who are affected by <img class="inline harmonic-sensitivity"> [Harmonic Sensitivity] will take additional damage.
- **Focused Fluxlance** - also known as "red arrow". Instantly kills all players it hits.

Lances are summoned whenever Decima casts one of the following skills:

- **Fluxlance Fusillade** - targets the five furthest players with fluxlances. Targeted players will have a numeral above their head from one to five. After a brief delay, fires the lances in sequence based on their number.
- **Fluxlance Salvo** - targets the five furthest players with fluxlances. After a brief delay, fires all lances simultaneously.
