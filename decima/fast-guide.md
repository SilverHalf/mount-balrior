# Melee Boon/DPS Quick Guide

BoonDPS and DPS play their role similarly and thus are grouped together.
Your responsibilities over the entirety of the fight consist in:
1. Being close to the boss so that you are targeted by [Spreads].
2. Intercepting [Greens] on their way to the boss.

The main risks you have to be aware of are:
1. Being directly under the boss when she casts [Seismic Crash] or [Earthrend]; this will kill you.
2. Getting hit by an [Arrow] will prevent you from intercepting [Greens] without dying.

<summary>Phase 1</summary>
<div markdown='block'>

#### 100% - 80%
- Enter the arena using <img class='inline roll-out'> [Roll Out] or <img class='inline leap'> [Leap].
- Stack with your group on the side of the <img class='inline arrow'> marker and attack the boss.
- Make sure you never stand inside the boss' hitbox.
- When you get [Spreads], dodge them <b>inwards</b> and then reposition outside the boss' hitbox.
- When you see [Greens], intercept them by standing on them. Make sure you do not move out to do this: only intercept them when they are in melee range to the boss. Never move out of melee range.

#### First Split Phase
- Once Decima becomes <img class='inline invuln'> [Invulnerable], turn around 180° and walk forwards to get into your cage.
- Start attacking the [add], taking care not to CC it.
- Make sure you are standing on the inside of the add, towards Decima, to bait [Spreads]. When you get your spread, dodge it outwards, towards the add.
- Once the add is dead, your healer should provide you with a portal. Take it to get back to the boss.

#### 80% - 70%
Same as before. The first collection can be tricky: use your movement skills to get to [Greens] in time if necessary.

#### 70% Transition
- Save your DPS and CC skills once Decima hits 70%.
- Follow the boss when it jumps. Dodge any [Spreads].
- Use all your CC on the boss.

# Melee Healer Quick Guide

# Ranged Boon/DPS Quick Guide

Ranged BoonDPS and DPS play their role similarly and thus are grouped together.
Your responsibilities over the entirety of the fight consist in:
1. Being far from the boss so that you are targeted by [Arrows]. Try to stay at the limit of the [Thrumming Presence] AoE.
2. Pointing [Arrows] away from [Conduits] and other players.

The main risks you have to be aware of are:
1. Being hit by multiple [Arrows] in succession will make you <img class='inline exposed'> [Exposed] and probably down you.
2. Being further from your boss than the kiter will make the [Red Arrow] target you, which will kill you if you have no mobility.
3. Standing in [Greens] will quickly kill you.
