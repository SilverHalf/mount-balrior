# Melee Boon/DPS Quick Guide

Your responsibilities (excluding basic damage and support as required by your role) consist in:
1. Being close to the boss so that you are targeted by [Spreads].
2. Intercepting [Greens] on their way to the boss.

The main risks you should be aware of are:
1. Being directly under the boss when she casts [Seismic Crash] or [Earthrend]: this will kill you.
2. Getting hit by an [Arrow]: this will prevent you from intercepting [Greens] without dying.

#### General Information for all Phases
- Make sure you never stand inside the boss' hitbox.
- Never move out of melee range from the boss.
- When you get [Spreads], dodge them <b>inwards</b> and then reposition outside the boss' hitbox. You can stack spreads with other players, and dodge all of them at once.
- When you see [Greens], intercept them by standing on them. Make sure you do not move from the boss to do this: only intercept them when they are in melee range, while remaining on the edge of the boss's hitbox.

# Ranged Boon/DPS Quick Guide

Your responsibilities (excluding basic damage and support as required by your role) consist in:
1. Being far from the boss so that you are targeted by [Arrows].
2. Pointing [Arrows] away from [Conduits] and other players.

The main risks you should be aware of are:
1. Being hit by multiple [Arrows] in succession will make you <img class='inline exposed'> [Exposed] and probably down you.
2. Being further from your boss than the kiter will make the [Red Arrow] target you, which will kill you if you have no mobility.
3. Standing in [Greens] will quickly kill you.

#### General Information for all Phases
- During damage phases, try to always stay just inside the [Thrumming Presence] AoE unless you know what you're doing.
- When you get an [Arrow], spread out so you are not overlapping or pointing it at a [Conduit].
- Make sure you are never stacking farther from the boss than your kiter.
