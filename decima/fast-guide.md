# Melee Boon/DPS Guide

Your responsibilities (excluding basic damage and support as required by your role) consist in:
1. Being close to the boss so that you are targeted by [Spreads].
2. Intercepting [Greens] on their way to the boss.

#### General Information for all Phases
- Never linger inside the boss' hitbox: [Seismic Crash] or [Earthrend] will kill you.
- Never move out of melee range from the boss. If you are  hit by an [Arrow] you cannot collect [Greens].
- When you get [Spreads], dodge them <b>inwards</b> at the last second. You can stack spreads with other players, and dodge all of them at once.
- When you see [Greens], intercept them by standing on them. Make sure you do not move from the boss to do this: only intercept them when they are in melee range, while remaining on the edge of the boss's hitbox.

# Melee Healer Guide

# Ranged Boon/DPS Guide

Your responsibilities (excluding basic damage and support as required by your role) consist in:
1. Being far from the boss so that you are targeted by [Arrows].
2. Pointing [Arrows] away from [Conduits] and other players.

#### General Information for all Phases
- During damage phases, try to always stay on the limit of the [Thrumming Presence] AoE.
- When you get an [Arrow], spread out so you are not overlapping or pointing it at a [Conduit]. Being hit by multiple [Arrows] in succession will give you <img class='inline exposed'> [Exposed] and probably down you.
- Make sure you are closer to the boss than your kiter. This prevents you from baiting the [Red Arrow].
- Avoid standing in [Greens]: they will quickly kill you.
