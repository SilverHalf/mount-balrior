# Mount Balrior Raid Guide

This is a website that contains guides and information for the [Mount Balrior](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mount_Balrior) raid instance in [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com).

This website is built using [Jekyll] and the [Just the Docs] theme, enabling it to be previewed locally and then published on [GitHub Pages] using the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow].

## Viewing the site locally

You will need to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Jekyll], and possibly [Bundler].

1.  Clone this repository, open a terminal and change your working directory to its root directory.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome, as the project is in its starting phases.
