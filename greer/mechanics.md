| Gree, the Bringer | 23,594,400 | 600 | |
| Reeg, the Blighter | 23,594,400 | 600 | |

| Champion Proto-Greerling | 5,112,120 | 600 | |
| Elite Empowering Beast | 236,003 | 240 | 500 |


## Attachs that are used

These enemies will use a variety of different attacks.

| **Attack** | **Typical called name** | **Target** | **Used by (Cooldown [s])** | **Description** |
| Blob of Blight | Death orbs | Furthest player | Greer (120), Gree (75), Ereg (75) | 3 subsequent large homing orbs that spawn projectiles. Can be despawned by other running through them with Invulns (Distort, Mistform, ..), or by dodging through them.
| Cage of Decay | Arrows | Tank | Greer (120), Gree (30) | 5 Arrows that spawn subsequent projectiles spawning from the two outer Arrows going inward. Either stand in between the Arrows, or immediately dodge through them. |
| Empowering Blast | Empowered orbs | Greer and other lesser Titans | lesser titans (10) | Small purple orbs that Empower Greer, need to be projectile blocked as much as possible. |
| Enfeebling Miasma | Cones, Poison cones | Tank | Greer (120), Gree (75), Ereg, (75) | The cones booncorrupt, but also leave some poisonous clouds behind. Do not move into them at all cost, because they will apply Plague Rot and can wipe you very quickly. Either immediately stand between cones, or dodge through the boss. |
| Eruption of Rot | Greens | Random | Greer (120), lesser titans (75) | Greens need either 2, or 3 players in them. Can be solved, or dodged, but when dodged, you will leave behind an AoE field that boon corrupts. Dodging Greens also makes them count as failed, which will give 2x stacks of <img class="inline empowered"> [Empowered](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Empowered_(Greer,_the_Blightbringer)) to Greer (except if Greens are stacked such that enough players are inside). |
| Rain of Spores | Artillery barrage | Furthest players | Greer (120), Reeg (120), Ereg (120) | Indicated by small orange circles on the ground. Either avoid, or put projectile destruction up. |
| Ripples of Rot | Jump | Closest player, but only if no player is in their extended melee range | Greer (120), Gree (30) | If this attack happens (typically may happen during Split phases by Gree, or during 10% by Gree) run away from the impact zone in order to avoid the damage, boon corrupt and Plage Rot parts of this attack. |
| Scattering Sporeblast | Barrage | Tank | Greer (12), Reeg (8), Ereg (8) | Can be projectile blocked. |
| Stomp the Growth | Slam, Stomp, Wave | Tank | Greer (2), Gree (2), Reeg (2) | Is a three-part attack chain that can be mitigated by <img class="inline aegis"> [Aegis](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aegis), blocks, or dodge. The third and final part releases a boon corrupting wave that can be jumped, or dodge. |
| Sweep the Mold | Autoattack, Cone | Tank | Greer (2), Gree (2) | Two subsequent cone attacks that can be sidestepped. [Aegis](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aegis), blocks, or dodge also work. |
| Plague Rot | Reds | applied by other mechanics (Arrows, Cones, Jump) |  | Only happens when players make mistakes. This attack is indicated by Red AoEs around players that also infect other players. Immediately spread apart to not spread it across the squad and wait until the debuff disappears. |

## Boons on the titans
The fight starts with Greer, Gree, Reeg, and Ereg all being alive and attackable at their specific spawn location. While Gree, Reeg, or Ereg are alive (called, the lesser titans, hereafter), they will give boons that are shared between each other and Greer. Gree gives <img class="inline protection"> [Protection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Protection), Reeg <img class="inline resolution"> [Resolution](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Resolution) and Ereg <img class="inline might"> [Might](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Might). Bringing the lesser titans to a certain health threshold, makes them despawn for the current phase and consequently stops the respective boon being spread. Hence, Power-based squad compositions should start on Gree, while Condition-based squads should focus on Reeg.

## Empowered Orbs
While the three lesser titans are alive, they will also regularly (every 10 to 14 seconds) shoot Empowering Orbs targeted at all the other titans, that will give a stack of <img class="inline empowered"> [Empowered](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Empowered_(Greer,_the_Blightbringer)) when they reach their target.
