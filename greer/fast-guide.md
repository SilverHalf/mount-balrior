# Heal Chronomancer Quick Guide

Your responsibilities (excluding basic healing and support as required by your role) consist in:
1. Providing <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] and <img class='inline aegis'> [Aegis] for most, if not all mechanics.
2. Intercepting [Death Orbs] using <img class='inline distortion'> [Distortion] to delete them.
3. Providing backup projectile reflection with <img class='inline feedback'> [Feedback].
4. Aggro-ing certain adds during the split phases.
5. Providing large amounts of CC.

The main risks you should be aware of are:
1. Failing to provide defensive boons may cause your squad to die to other mechanics.
2. Undeleted [Death Orbs] can quickly destabilize your squad.

#### General Information for all Phases
- Save your <img class='inline stab-mantra'> [Mantra of Concentration] for the [Swipes]. You can often block both swipes with a single cast if well timed. Call out if you don't have it for mechanics.
- Save your <img class='inline precog'> [Well of Precognition] for the [Slams]. This becomes more important the more the fight progresses. Call out if you don't have it for a slam.
- Save your <img class='inline distortion'> [Distortion] for [Death Orbs]. Sort out with your fellow <img class='inline chrono'> [Chronomancer] who does the first set of orbs and who the second, and call out whenever you are deleting.
- When your bubble player calls for backup (usually by saying "Bubble Down"), you should pick a side of the boss (usually by calling "Double"/"Single") and place your <img class='inline feedback'> [Feedback] when you see [Empowering Orbs] come from your direction.
- If possible, save your <img class='inline cs'> [Continuum Split] for the CC phases.
- Make sure you are dodging or jumping the shockwave component of Greer's [Slams].
- Sidestep all arrows. Try to provide <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for them if you can spare it.

# Bubble Quick Guide

Your responsibilities (excluding basic damage and support as required by your role) consist in:
1. Intercepting [Empowering Orbs] to prevent the boss from getting <img class='inline empowered'> [Empowered].

#### General Information for all Phases
- Throughout most damage phases, [Empowering Orbs] will come in sets of three from the two adds (as a "double" and a "single").
