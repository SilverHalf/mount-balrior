# Heal Chronomancer Guide

[<img class='inline build'> Builds and PoVs](./strategy.html#builds-and-povs){: .btn}

Your responsibilities (excluding basic healing and support as required by your role) consist in:
1. Providing <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] and <img class='inline aegis'> [Aegis] for most, if not all mechanics.
2. Intercepting [Blighted Orbs] using <img class='inline distortion'> [Distortion] to delete them.
3. Providing backup projectile reflection with <img class='inline feedback'> [Feedback].
4. Aggro-ing certain adds during the split phases.
5. Providing large amounts of CC.

#### General Information for all Phases
- Save your <img class='inline stab-mantra'> [Mantra of Concentration] for the [Swipes]. You can often block both swipes with a single cast if well timed. Call out if you don't have it for mechanics.
- Save your <img class='inline precog'> [Well of Precognition] for the [Slams]. This becomes increasingly important as the fight progresses. Call out if you don't have it for a slam.
- Save your <img class='inline distortion'> [Distortion] for [Blighted Orbs]. Sort out with your fellow <img class='inline chrono'> [Chronomancer] who does the first set of orbs and who the second, and call out whenever you are deleting.
- When your bubble player calls for backup (usually by saying "Bubble Down"), you should pick a side of the boss (usually by calling "Double"/"Single") and use your <img class='inline feedback'> [Feedback] to block [Empowering Orbs] from your direction when you see them.
- If possible, save your <img class='inline cs'> [Continuum Split] for the CC phases.
- Make sure you are dodging or jumping the shockwave component of Greer's [Slams].
- Sidestep all arrows. Try to provide <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for them if you can spare it.

<details class=faq>
<summary>Phase 1</summary>
<div markdown='block'>
- Start on [Reeg].
- You will have a first set of [Blighted Orbs] just before [Greens]. If you are responsible for this first set, it could be your responsibility to aggro the boss and pull it to the group.
- You may be responsible of blocking the first set of [Empowering Orbs] from [Gree] and [Ereg]. In this case, after deleting the [Blighted Orbs], use <img class='inline cs'> [Continuum Split] to double-cast <img class='inline feedback'> [Feedback] so that both directions are covered.

- If you get a [Green] while off-stack, try to dodge it or call for a buddy to help you out.
- Once [Reeg] is gone or close to 50%, move to [Gree]. Stack on the outside of Gree so that [Ereg] walks to you.

- Play the beginning of the phase positioned towards the center of the arena.

- Throughout most damage phases, [Empowering Orbs] will come in sets of three from the two adds (as a "double" and a "single").
- During CC phases at 80%, 50% and 20%, several [Empowering Beasts] will spawn. These will often cast [Empowering Orbs], so make sure you always have reflection up.
