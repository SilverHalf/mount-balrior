# Recommended Greer Strategy

There are two strategies that are generally playable well, one being with a dedicated Tank and one without a Tank. Here, we focus only on the non-Tank version, because it's the most commonly played strategy in pug runs.

The non-Tank strategy is commonly called 'cozy' strat and essentially requires two Heal Chronomancers making heavy use of Stability and Aegis, a Ventari Quick Herald (can also be another Revenant build that uses Ventari) and a Celestial hybrid Scourge (can technically also be another build, but it needs to be tanky enough. More on that later). The rest of the squad are any 6x dps builds, but due to how Greer boon mechanics work, it's typical to use either a full Condition, or full Power based squad. In the following, we assume a Condition based composition. When running power, what changes is where you start the fight and where you go in split phases, which is at/to Gree instead of Reeg.

The fight starts on the ledge to the right-hand side when moving from the Camp to Greer's arena. Simply jump down into the arena which will start the fight.

## 100% - 65%

After the fight has been initiated, Reeg will be attackable shortly afterward. The supports want to very quickly provide boons. One of the Heal Chronos will then run toward Greer to Distort the Death balls (coming from Greer) and to at the same time lure Greer close to Reeg. In order to do this properly, you want to stay more than ~900 range away from Greer, because otherwise he will start using his Swipe attacks and thereby delaying his movement. 

The squad at Reeg will have to solve a Green, while dps'ing Reeg as quickly as possible to 75%. Once Greer is close enough, you can stand between Reeg and Greer to cleave both. The Ventari Herald needs to pay attention at that point and regularly block the [Empowering Blast] (small orbs) coming from the Gree and Ereg toward Greer in order to keep [Empowered] stacks low on Greer. Whenever the Ventari Herald can't block for any reason, make sure to call for backup projectile block in voice; usually there is at least one more Scourge with [Corrosive Poison Cloud] and the two Heal Chronos should run [Feedback]. Next, the squad stays on the outer side of Greer until he uses his cone attack, after which the squad will dodge/move through Greer toward the inner side of his hitbox (if Reeg is not phase to 75% yet, you need to move back for a bit to finish Reeg). Roughly at the same time the second Heal Chrono needs to be ready to Distort the second set of Death balls (this time coming from Ereg from the North-East of the arena).

Then follows the 'main' component of fighting Greer, which revolves around providing Stability for the swipes (or sidestepping if no Stability is available) and, more importantly, using [Well of Precognition] from the Heal Chronos to Aegis the Slam attack (Circle attack; 2x slam into Boon Corrupt Wave). To do this, it's important that the squad is stacked up. If any of the Heal Chronos doesn't have [Well of Precognition] ready, say so in voice such that people can use their dodge. It's not as important in the early phases when Greer's [Empowered] stacks are low, but this is crucial later on, because taking those slam attacks to the face can very quickly wipe the squad. The third hit, the Boon Corrupt Wave, can simply be jumped, dodged or avoided (standing exactly in the center). Whenever the [Cage of Decay] (Arrow attack) comes, just make sure to stand between two arrows.

Once Greer hits 80%, a breakbar will appear. After breaking it, the Ventari Herald (and any other projectile block you have in your squad) be ready to block the additional [Empowering Blast] that will be spawned from the Elite Empowered Beasts that spawn after the Breakbar is broken. At 65%, the boss will disappear and the first split phase begins. Note that Conditions keep ticking at the boss, you no damage will be wasted. Note that if dps is on the lower side, you may have another set of [Blob of Blight] coming from the North, so one of the Heal Chronos need to be ready to distort those.


## First Split Phase

Everyone in the squad except one Heal Chrono goes to Reeg, which will be located in the Northwest. The one Heal Chrono not going there will go to Gree (Northeast) to bring Gree toward Reeg. Note that depending on dps, the mentioned [Blob of Blight] at the end of P1 may also need to be distorted by this Heal Chrono walking to Gree, or with very high dps, will not appear at all. For baiting Gree properly and quickly, try to keep some distance in order to not trigger Gree's melee swipe attacks (similar to how baiting Greer at the start of the fight works). Note that Gree may use his Jump attack, which needs to be avoided at all cost, so if it's cast, just run away, regroup and after the attack is over go back to melee range for continuing.

In parallel, while the squad is at Reeg, [Blob of Blight] from Reeg and possibly from Ereg will be casted (Ereg depends if it was used at the end of P1 or not). This means the Heal Chrono on the stack needs to distort the [Blob of Blight] from Reeg and if [Blob of Blight] from Ereg come delayed, they need to be dodged. To dodge them properly, dodge into them, which will make them disappear. If the dodge is failed, just make sure to immediately walk away in order to not die (standing under a non-deleted orb will quickly kill you). Additionally, there will also be Greens that need to be done. There is a chance that the solo Heal Chrono who baits Gree gets a Green as well, the easiest way to deal with that is to just dodge it (you can also weapon swap to Spear and use Spear 3 into Dodge for a longer invuln-period to dodge correctly).

Reeg will use the artillery attack regularly, blasting everyone with projectiles. This can simply be mitigated by having projectile blocks up, so communicate accordingly to always have some block up. Once Reeg, hits 50%, Reeg will disappear and the dps can swap Gree. Note that similar to Greer when phasing, Reeg also does not go invulnerable, which means applied Conditions keep ticking and no damage is wasted. After Reeg has disappeared, the focus shifts to Gree and Ereg. Note that if you are doing the achievement to keep Ereg alive, you will only focus Gree, but if you want to kill Ereg, you can dps Gree until Ereg comes into melee range and then switch to Ereg. Note that you want to stand on the outer side of Gree/Ereg in order to bait the Cone attack from Ereg away from the center, so as soon as this happens, dodge through the Ereg to the inner side (this is also done when Arrows happen, see next paragraph).

Gree will use the Swipe and Slam attacks that Greer also uses, but without the Boon Corrupt Wave. Use Stability for Swipes and Well of Precognition against the Slam. Furthermore, Gree might also use the Arrow attack. Note that the Arrows projectiles stop at the edge of the arena and don't travel their full distance. This means when Gree is standing close to the edge of the arena, the large boon corrupt AoE can quickly and surprisingly appear under the squad. For this reason it's crucial to immediately go toward the inner side of the Gree when the Arrow attack happens. Ereg will also use the artillery attack regularly, so keep projectile blocks up. Depending on dps. 

Once Gree hits 50% hp, the split phase is over.


## 65% - 35%

Greer will become activate again and the first attack will be [Blob of Blight]. This means when running back to the boss, have one Heal Chrono ready to distort those balls and everyone else run stacked together, behind the Heal Chrono. After the [Blob of Blight] are dealt with, run past Greer to Reeg, which spawns at the original position next to Greer again. In order to remove the Resolution boon from Greer, Reeg needs to be dps'd to 25%. The Ventari Herald needs to pay attention again the whole time and block all [Empowering Blast].

Very shortly after, there will be some Greens that need to be solved. These come from Reeg, which will be a two person Green and from Greer, which will be 2x three person Greens. If they happen delayed, you can solve all of them relatively easily, but if they happen at the same time, it's easier to dodge the two person Green and solve both three person Greens (the reason to dodge the two person Green is that the 3 person Greens give [Empowered] stacks to the boss then failed and dodging it counts as failure, while the two person Green will not give stacks to the boss when failed -- Greens give stacks to the caster, so the failed two person Green will just give stacks to Reeg, which doesn't matter). On top of Greens, the boss might also cast Slams on top and due to the Greens, the group might be spread. So use your [Well of Precognition] and/or dodges, but especially with dodges, be careful to not dodge out of the Green, or the Green person dodge away from the group.

Reeg and Greer might also use artillery skills during that time, so have your [Corrosive Poison Cloud] and [Feedback] ready to use it on top of the squad. Stay on the outer side of Greer until Greer has used the cone attack (even when Reeg is already despawned, wait for the cone attack) and then go through the boss toward the inner side (same as the start of the fight in phase 1).

The rest of this phase is similar to the first phase. Deal with the mechanics appropriately (block Orbs, Stability Swipe, Precog Slam, ..), with a Breakbar that appears at 60%. Similar to before, after breaking the bar, Elite Empowering Beasts will appear and cast [Empowering Blast] toward Greer, so make sure to block all of those and communicate if any backup projectile block is needed.

## Second Split Phase

The second split phase is similar to the first one. The Heal Chronos have to deal with [Blob of Blight], one of the Heal Chronos has to bait Gree and otherwise the squad will move and dps Reeg in the Northwest. This time, the phase ends when Reeg and Gree are fully killed. In case you keep Ereg alive, simply ignore Ereg, otherwise try to focus Ereg as soon as Ereg is in melee range. All things mentioned in the first split phase apply again. Once Reeg and Gree are dead, the next boss phase will start.


## 35% - 10%

If you decide to kill Ereg, the squad stays on Ereg and kills him. One of the Heal Chronos can run to Greer in order to bait him closer already and to distort [Blob of Blight], which will be casted from Greer at the start of this phase. [Blob of Blight] timing from Ereg depends on the squad dps again and might happen either toward the end of the split phase, or sometime soon at the start of this phase, so the second Heal Chrono also needs to be ready to distort that. After Greer used [Blob of Blight], Greer will use Greens. This will be a set of 3x three person Greens (often called 'triple Greens'). The easiest way to deal with those is to stack them, which will cause them to count as successful for the part of giving [Empowered] stacks to the boss, but will down the players, because of multiple Green hits. Hence, you want to dodge the triple Greens together. For this, coordinate to stack next to the boss a bit outside of melee range and dodge toward the boss together. Timing wise, Ereg might also use his two person Green ability, which can be solved on the stack. At this point, Ereg should be close to dying. With a Condition based squad composition, you can leave Ereg and switch dps to the Greer around 7% hp.

At this point, there will be no more regular [Empowering Blast], because all lesser Titans are dead. However, at 20% there will be another breakbar and after this another set of Elite Empowering Beasts will spawn. Be ready to block the [Empowering Blast] orbs from those.

Once Greer reaches ~11%, everyone (except the 10% tank) can start moving away from Greer to the opposite side of the arena together. Conditions will bring Greer to 10% at which point the next phase starts. The 10% tank is typically a Celestial Hybrid Scourge.


## Proto Phase

Once Greer hits 10%, Greer becomes immune and three Champion Proto-Greerling will spawn at random locations in the arena (there are 12 possible spawnpoints -- see image below -- but which of those 12 the three spawn, are random). 

<img class="center" width="100%" src="../images/greer/strategy/protolings_spawnpoints.webp" />

The 10% tank stays on Greer with the task being to keep Greer away from the rest of the squad. However, in order to survive, evading all attacks as good as possible is necessary and if you are unlucky and a Protoling spawns close to Greer and moves to the 10% tank, the tank needs to come earlier back to the squad in order to survive. In any case, be prepared that Greer may use the Jump attack and quickly run away together as squad if that happens.

The squad kills the Champion Proto-Greerlings as fast as possible. Simply move either toward a Protoling that is far away from Greer, or in case two are stacked together, move toward those. Usually you play with extra dps Scourges and one of them can try to bait any extra Protolings that are away toward the squad. Other then that, it is important to constantly stay stacked together, because the Champs will use artillery attacks, which need to be projectile blocked and use the Swipe and Slam attacks for which Stability and Aegis is helpful. Communicate in voice for projectile blocks and whenever there is no [Well of Precognition], such that people know they need to use dodges, or sidestep AoEs. It's always good to try and evade as many attacks whenever possible, while staying close together. But, always use your dodge before you die from the next AoE attack! 

Sometimes it can happen that the last Protoling is close to Greer. In those cases, just focus the Protoling while trying to evade all Greer attacks. The besides the plethora of AoEs that need to be evaded, special attention has to be given to two attacks: First, [Blob of Blight] will be casted at some point during the 10% phase, so one of the Heal Chronos needs to be ready to distort when this happens. Second, Triple Greens will also happen likely at some point toward the end of the 10% phase. Play these similarly to the ones before, which is stacked together, moving to a spot free from AoEs and slightly away from the boss and finally dodging toward the boss. If one person fails the dodge, either use a Scourge ress signet, or press F if no AoEs, or other danger is nearby.

Once the last Protoling is close to dying, switch to Greer already to pre-stack Conditions.

## 10% - 0%

Greer will take damage again once the last Protoling is died. At the death of the last Protoling, a 30 second timer starts after which the Protolings respawn, which is essentially a wipe. That's why pre-stacking Conditions toward the end of the 10% phase is important, because it effectively removes a large part of the ramping up from Conditions. Greer continues to use his mechanics. It's best to sidestep AoEs to prevent as much damage as possible, but especially for Slams, having [Well of Precognition] up is essential to surviving. Communicate in voice if Precog is not ready and in that case use dodges to survive!
