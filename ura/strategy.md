# Ura Recommended Strategy
{: .no_toc}

This strategy for <u>Challenge Mode</u> focuses on smoothing out communications regarding everything that has to do with [Bloodstone Shards] and <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel]. This is often the hardest part of the encounter: making sure a *shard* is available, used, and then picked up as fast as possible every time it becomes necessary for a new mechanic.

This is best achieved through a proper division of roles, where different parts of the squad circulate different *shards* to take care of specific threats, while also trying to provide good damage, boon uptime, and defensive utility.

---

#### General Points
- The squad divides into a _ranged group_ and a _melee group_. Each of these groups rotates a single [Bloodstone Shard] to take care of different mechanics
- The *ranged group* takes care of [Toxic Geysers]
- The *melee group* takes care of [Bubbles] and [Titanspawners]
- [Ura] is tanked from the third phase onwards to prevent her from casting [Propel]
- The boss <img class='inline defiance'> [Defiance Bar] must only be broken at specific intervals from the third phase onwards, to prevent her from casting [Propel]

The rest of this page is structured into the following sections:

2. [Group Division](#group-division) - information on the division between ranged and melee groups
3. [Preventing Propel](#preventing-propel) - information on tanking and CC timings to avoid [Propel]

<img class=divider>

## Composition

[Ura] Challenge Mode is generally played with three healers, who must bring high amounts of crowd control to deal with [Toxic Geysers] and <img class='inline titanicresistance'> [Titanic Resistance]. Furthermore, they benefit from high survivability and mobility to facilitate mechanics, and <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for their subgroups. For these reasons, the most commonly played specialization in this role is <img class='inline chrono'> [Chronomancer], followed by <img class='inline druid'> [Druid], <img class='inline scourge'> [Scourge] <font size=2>(often with a Celestial build)</font>, and <img class='inline specter'> [Specter].

[<img class='inline chrono'> Chronomancer Build](https://gw2skills.net/editor/?PigEQiWmBDhZxuYj4RPp26A-DSRYjR1VPSIFlRLpQ6VluvGCSo83S7bWQFA-e){: .btn} [<img class='inline scourge'> Scourge Build](https://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?PSAFw8laYZGMJ2DLiNip6V2rH-DSRYjRPV1HSI1ALkWigqLg0TBdvNEkQZP8aQwmFoC-e){: .btn} [<img class='inline druid'> Druid Build](https://gw2skills.net/editor/?POwEYKNssBmC7gxwKxxXSvpVi37B-DSRYjRwHCSUjuLjqrq0TBfvOEkQ5vl23sgKA-e){: .btn}
{: .center}

BoonDPS can bring additional utility to the fight, such as extra CC and <img class='inline stability'> [Stability], but this is not usually a limiting factor. Damage players can bring both <img class='inline power'> [Power] and <img class='inline condition'> [Condition] builds, though it is beneficial to bring a couple of <img class='inline power'> [Power] builds to handle [Titanspawn Geysers], since they have lower overall <img class='inline toughness'> [Toughness]. 
<br>
The fight also benefits builds with high cleave damage for both [Titanspawners] and [Champion Fumarollers], and extra mobility for easily placing [Sulfuric Geysers].

Usually, one or two of the DPS players will have the additional responsibility of being a *tank* through the third and fourth phase of the fight. These should play a high damage build, since they will not participate in some mechanics and thus will have the greatest damage uptime on the boss. 
<br>
See [tanking Ura](#tanking-ura) for more information.

---

An example of a squad composition could be as follows:

|       | Heal              | DPS/Hybrid Support | DPS       | DPS       | DPS       |
| Sub 1 | <img class="inline chrono"> [Chrono] | DPS Support        | <img class='inline power'> [Power] | <img class='inline power'> [Power] | Any DPS  |
| Sub 2 | <img class="inline chrono"> [Chrono] | Hybrid/Full Heal   | Any DPS   | Any DPS   | Any DPS   |

---

## Group Division

The most important concept underpinning this strategy is the way it manages [Bloodstone Shards] by dividing the squad into two groups:
- A _ranged group_ containing the three healers shares one shard <font size=2>(<em>ranged shard</em>)</font>, using it to <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] all [Toxic Geysers] throughout the fight.
- A _melee group_ containing everyone else, except for the tank, shares the other *shard* <font size=2>(<em>melee shard</em>)</font>, using it to <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] the [Pressure Blast] (aka Friends, Bubbles) and [Titanspawn Geysers].

Before the fight starts, it is common practice to set up the order in which players will use the shard, often called the *"rotation"*. In this way, whenever a player is about to use a *shard*, they can call out the next person in the rotation and the location where it will be dropped, so that they can be prepared to pick it up. 
<br>
Having a rotation is extremely important for the *ranged group*, but confident squads often forgo an explicit *melee shard* rotation; instead trusting players to pick up the shard whenever their [Bloodstone Saturation] debuff runs out.

#### Marker Packs
{: .no_toc}

Especially for the *ranged group*, it is extremely beneficial to install [HasKha's Markers](https://github.com/HasKha/gw2-markers) for [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/)'s [Pathing Module](https://blishhud.com/modules/?module=bh.community.pathing). This pack will show an overlay for geysers, allowing players to use numbered [Toxic Geyser] spawn positions as shown [here](/mechanics.html#toxic-geysers) for callouts. The pack can be installed directly from the Pathing Module's marker repository.

Alternatively, groups can use *in-game markers*. This is a less desirable option compared to the overlay, since there are 14 spawn locations and only 8 different markers available. The following marker pack (requires [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/)'s [Commander Markers](https://blishhud.com/modules/?module=Manlaan.CommanderMarkers) module) makes the certain optimizations to manage this issue:

- Markers on [Toxic Geysers] number 5, 8, 9, and 12.
- Markers between [Toxic Geysers] that are usually double dropped: 1 & 2, 3 & 4, 7 & 10, 13 & 14.
- No marker on 11 because it's in the boss anyways, so it's an easy one to remember, especially when you have the marker on 8 as reference point.

## Preventing [Propel]
{: .no_toc}

In the third and fourth phase, [Ura] regains access to [Propel]. It is possible to entirely prevent her from casting this skill and keep her stationary in a central position. 
This allows for easy access to [Titanspawn Geysers], safe drop-points for [Sulfuric Geysers], prevents her from entering the area of [Toxic Geysers] and [Sulfuric Geysers], and by extension also increases damage uptime.

The reason why this is possible is that [Ura] has many skills with a higher priority than [Propel]. The table belowcontains rough times for several of her skills:

|Skill                     |Priority|Cooldown [s]|Cast Time [s]|Aftercast [s]|
|[Pressure Blast]          |1       |25          |5            |1.5          |
|[Create Titanspawn Geyser]|2       |30          |5            |2            |
|[Sulfuric Geyser]         |3       |20          |5            |4            |
|[Steam Prison]            |4       |15          |7            |5            |
|[Propel]                  |5       |12          |4            |2            |

The total cast time for all of the higher priority skills comes down to around 34.5 seconds: enough for the first one cast to come off cooldown as the last ones are concluding. This means that there will always be a higher priority skill in Ura's queue, which will always be selected over [Propel].

[Ura] can still use her jump in two situations:
- If a higher priority skill is skipped due to having no valid targets
- If a higher priority skill gets interrupted by breaking the <img class='inline defiance'> [Defiance Bar], removing the skill's cast and aftercast from the queue

To avoid these two situations, the appropriate countermeasures are: [tanking Ura](#tanking-ura) and [controlling when her defiance is broken](#when-to-cc-ura).

---

#### Tanking Ura

A *"tank"* is necessary to always provide a target for [Ura]'s high priority skills so that she does not skip them to cast [Propel]. The designated *tank* should stand, in front of the boss, within a 400 range, in a 140° cone. A *backup tank* should also be designated, in case the *tank* has a mechanic there is always someone capturing [Ura]'s aggro.

<img class='center' src='../images/ura/ura-cone.webp' width='70%'>

Whenever [Ura] chooses a random target for [Steam Prison] and [Sulfuric Geyser], she will rotate to track this target: the *tank* should always be ready to reposition accordingly. This can also be used to face the boss in certain directions. For example, facing her North-West places the stack the shortest possible distance from safe [Sulfuric Geyser] drop zones.

---

#### When to CC Ura

Breaking [Ura]'s <img class='inline defiance'> [Defiance Bar] at an incorrect time can cause a cascade effect leading to a [Propel].

---

The best moments to CC [Ura] correspond with the following skills:
1. [Create Titanspawn Geyser] - once in the air, and up to 5 seconds after she lands. The safest moment to CC.
<img class='center' src='../images/ura/ura-cc-jumpslam.gif' width='70%'>
2. [Steam Prison] - once she lowers her arms and the arena becomes active, for 3 seconds.
<img class='center' src='../images/ura/ura-cc-donutmove.gif' width='70%'>
3. [Sulfuric Geyser] - once the indicator starts, which is roughly when she has stretched her arm out front fully, for about 2-3 seconds.
<img class='center' src='../images/ura/ura-cc-sulfanim.gif' width='70%'>

<div style="color: grey">Gifs by Elise</div>

It is **not** recommended to CC during [Pressure Blast] as it is the most difficult timing.

<img class=divider>

## Phase 1

### 100% - 70%
{: .no_toc}

The fight starts when both [Bloodstone Shards] are picked up. Usually a player from the *melee group* picks up the first one, then a player from the *ranged group* picks up the second when everyone is in position to start the fight.

Throughout this phase <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] must be used to manage [Pressure Blast] <font size=2>(aka <em>Bubbles</em>)</font> and [Toxic Geysers].

---

#### Handling Bubbles
{: .no_toc}

The two players targeted by [Pressure Blast] should stack together, separate from the rest of the group, ideally in melee to upkeep DPS.
<br>
Stacking, regardless of where, allows the *melee shard holder* to save both players with a single <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel]. The *shard holder* will not be affected by [Pressure Blast], meaning they can stack on top of their affected teammates.

If there is a rotation, players should call out the next person after using their *shard*, who should then quickly pick it up. Since there is little other pressure for the melee players in this phase, groups progressing the fight should use it to practice their rotation and get it perfect for the following phases.

---

#### Baiting [Propel]
{: .no_toc}

Throughout this phase, [Ura] will usually use [Propel] after every [Pressure Blast] <font size=2>(this can change)</font>. Players in the *ranged group* should be aware of this and try to bait the jump away from geysers into potentially advantageous positions. An example movement pattern is shown in the image below:

<img class="center" width="70%" src="../images/ura/ura_propel_p1.webp" />

---

#### Double Sharding [Toxic Geysers]
{: .no_toc}

Throughout the first phase, the spawn rate of [Toxic Geysers] is doubled compared to the rest of the fight. This means that players in the *ranged group* must <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] **two** [Toxic Geysers] every time it's their turn in the rotation. This is called *"Double Sharding"*, and involves using <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] on a geyser, quickly picking up the [Bloodstone Shard], moving to a second geyser, and using <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] again. In between the two uses, the shard holder must survive the ticking damage from <img class='inline saturation'> [Bloodstone Saturation], which removes 20% of their maximum HP per second.

To simplify *double sharding*, it is best to wait for both [Toxic Geysers] to spawn before using <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] on the first, so as to not have to wait between casts. Mobility skills are also extremely useful for quickly moving from one geyser to the other, though not strictly necessary.

{: .note}
> As an alternative strategy: groups can *"single shard"* by assigning one subgroup to the *ranged* rotation and the other to the *melee* rotation. While this is much safer, as the *ranged group* will not take any damage from <img class='inline saturation'> [Bloodstone Saturation], it is also less common in kill runs as it does not provide the same role compression as *double sharding*. 
> <br>
> Furthermore, if you are interested in clearing the <a class=uralm href='../ura-lcm/overview.html'>Legendary Mode</a>, learning how to double shard will help you in the long run.

Once a geyser has been <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispelled], breaking its <img class='inline defiance'> [Defiance Bar] will kill it. Analogously, using <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] on a geyser with a broken <img class='inline defiance'> [Defiance Bar] will kill it. Since geysers do not regenerate defiance in Challenge Mode, as soon as one spawns the *ranged group* can start doing some CC damage to it, so that it is more easily broken later on.

#### Example Ranged Shard Rotation
{: .no_toc}

|**Player**|**Pick Up #**|**First** <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel]|**Second** <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel]|
|Heal 1| - | 1 | 2 |
|Heal 2| 2 | 3 | 4 |
|Heal 3| 4 | 5 | 6 |
|Heal 1| 6 | 7 | 8 |
|...   |...|...|...|

<img class="center" width="70%" src="../images/ura/ura_toxic_geyser_spawns.webp" />

---

#### Other Information
{: .no_toc}

After using [Propel], [Ura] will generally use her [Autoattack Chain], which requires <img class='inline aegis'> [Aegis] or <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for the last hit. Players should always try to sidestep this skill, as their healers will often be off-stack doing mechanics.

[Ura] should be CC'd roughly whenever she gains 5 stacks of <img class='inline risingpressure'> [Rising Pressure]. This will help to keep the pace, while also not getting overwhelmed by the required amount of CC in the later phases.

<img class=divider>

## Phase 2
### 70% - 40%
{: .no_toc}

[Ura] will begin this phase by casting [Return] and then trapping everyone in [Bubbles]. This must be <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispelled] by the player holding *melee shard*. 
<br>
If [Ura] used [Pressure Blast] just before this transition, this player should **keep** their shard and use it to save both the targeted players and the rest of the group.

---

#### Managing Titanspawners
{: .no_toc}

[Ura] will use [Create Titanspawn Geyser] immediately after [Return] and as part of her rotation thereafter. Players should try to dodge the <img class="inline knockback"> [Knockback]; as soon as the skill cast is done, the squad should move to the [Titanspawn Geyser]'s location to quickly <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] it and burst it down.
<br>
**Remember to pick up the [Bloodstone Shard]!**


After the [Titanspawner] is dead, the squad should restack at the boss, and try to kill the [Champion Fumaroller] while still damaging [Ura].
<br>
[Fumarollers] target players and their summons; to draw a [Fumaroller] close enough to cleave, it is beneficial to stack opposite [Ura] from them and recall summons/pets.
Future casts of [Create Titanspawn Geyser] should be handled in the same manner.

Ideally the [Titanspawner] should be killed within 15 seconds, so that it doesn't spawn a second [Champion Fumaroller]. Since these adds inflict large amounts of crowd control and damage, having multiple can quickly snowball the fight out of control.

---

#### Placing Sulfurics
{: .no_toc}

[Sulfuric Geyser] casts will start in this phase, targeting random players. Depending on where the player is standing, they will want to run out and drop them at different locations. 

{: .note}
Below is a map that shows shaded purple areas, which are good locations to drop [Sulfurics]. Alternatively, [HasKha's Marker Pack](#marker-packs) also has indicators for safe sulfuric drop zones which are extremely useful.

Players should try to **avoid** running out in the North-East direction as the [Toxic Geysers] *#1* and *#2* are so far out, that you cannot make the distance without movement skills. This can cause geysers to drop on top of *#1* or *#2*, making the *ranged group's* unnecessarily harder.

Conversely, the most convenient position to drop [Sulfurics] is to the North-West: there is a large area there beyond the spawning points of *#9* and *#12* that is often close to the stack. This is further facilitated by the squad facing [Ura] in that direction (see [tanking Ura](#tanking-ura)).

<img class="center" width="70%" src="../images/ura/ura_sulfurics.webp" />

Players will gain <img class='inline superspeed'> [Superspeed] whenever they are targeted, which lasts right up until the final drop position is reached. The geyser will then spawn after a short time interval. Players can use this to know exactly when they can return to the stack.

{: .note}
If you have movement skills, always use them to get away from the boss and don't save them to get back quickly; getting further away and placing the geysers in safe spots is more important.

<img class='inline chrono'> [Chronomancers] should try to provide returning players with a <img class='inline rifle-portal'> [Dimensional Aperture] <font size=2>(Rifle 5)</font> to quickly bring them back to the stack.

---

#### Managing the Steam Prison
{: .no_toc}

[Steam Prison] should be placed far enough from the boss so that players can navigate around her without danger of going inside the arena.

{: .note}
Pay attention to not overlap it with any other mechanics, such as [Toxic Geysers].

For the most part, players can turn 180° degrees and run away from the boss immediately. Before the arena becomes active, the position of it is already fixed. You can use this brief period to use a movement skill or <img class='inline superspeed'> [Superspeed] in order to get out of its area before becoming trapped. This removes the need for <img class='inline stability'> [Stability], but requires precise timing. Try to practice this, as being stuck inside the arena in phase 3 and onwards can quickly become fatal.

---

#### Other Important Information
{: .no_toc}

It can happen in this phase and the following that [Pressure Blast] overlaps with [Create Titanspawn Geyser] or [Sulfuric Geyser] cast and you have a [Bubble] on the [Titanspawner] and one on [Ura]; especially if the [tank](#tanking-ura) is one of the targets! 
<br>
Each player who gets targeted should always look for the other immediately and move to a convenient position together. In the case of a [Titanspawner] and [Bubbles] overlap aiming to free the players on top of the [Titanspawn Geyser] itself is most efficient; this allows players to <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] both the [Bubbles] and the [Titanspawn] with one *shard*.

The [Toxic Geyser] order in this phase will restart from *#8*. If *#9* spawned in the previous phase, it can be convenient to reset it with CC, so that you only have to <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] it once, 24 seconds after *#8*. The *ranged group* will overall have an easier time managing [Toxics] in this phase, since their cooldown will increase from 12 to 24 seconds, no longer requiring double sharding. Players should keep calling where they use their shard so as to maintain the rotation.

<img class=divider>

## Phase 3
### 40% - 1%
{: .no_toc}

Once [Ura] hits 40%, she self-interrupts and will immediately cast [Pressure Blast]. This transition can be very hectic, especially if it occurs in proximity to [Create Titanspawn Geyser], as *melee shard* management becomes difficult. Calling it out in voice helps players prepare for the [Bubbles] and not be caught off-guard. 
<br>
The transition also resets [Toxic Geyser] spawn patterns: *#7* will spawn immediately and the timer will be reset. This means the *ranged group* may have to handle **two** [Toxics] in rapid succession. From here the *ranged group* will continue using their <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] only on [Toxic Geysers].

Starting from this phase, [Ura] has access to all mechanics from the previous two phases; including [Propel], it is therefore necessary to tank her and only CC at specific intervals.

The *melee group* will have to handle both [Pressure Blast] and [Create Titanspawn Geyser] for the rest of the fight. In particular, managing the [Bubbles] as soon as possible is important to make the skill to go on cooldown.

For the importance of a *tank*, CC management, and [Ura]'s skill cooldowns see [Preventing Propel](#preventing-propel).

<img class=divider>

## Post-Heal
### 16 - 0%
{: .no_toc}

On reaching 1% health, [Ura] will become <img class='inline invuln'> [Invulnerable], clear all <img class="inline condition"> [Conditions] from herself, and heal by 15% of her maximum HP.

Immediately after the transition, there will always be an additional [Titanspawn Geyser] independent of the [Create Titanspawn Geyser] skill. Groups in this phase may decide to kill only this titanspawner and additionally 1-2 others, while ignoring the rest, based on their distance from the boss. In case multiple [Champion Fumarollers] come to the stack, it's important to provide additional <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] and move off of any damaging AoEs so that they do not destabilize the squad.

Additionally, [Ura] will start targeting **two** players with [Sulfuric Geysers] instead of one per cast. It's best to drop the [Sulfuric Geysers] next to each other instead of in two different spots in order to use the space efficiently.

The [Toxic Geyser] pattern simply continues from the previous phase without interruptions. The *ranged group* can continue doing the first few as usual, with the added option of ignoring [Toxics] far from the boss as the group gets closer to a kill and they become less relevant.

With good DPS, confident groups can ignore all [Titanspawn Geysers] and only reset [Toxic Geysers] close to the boss.
