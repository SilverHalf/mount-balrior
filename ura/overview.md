Ura, the Steamshrieker, is the final boss of the Mount Balrior raid. To fight her, it is necessary to first defeat her two lieutenants, [Greer](../greer/overview.html) and [Decima](../decima/overview.html).

Ura, while a conceptually simple boss, requires high amounts of coordination, improvisation, and a higher level of consistency in DPS while executing mechanics cleanly. Stay on top of things as they happen while keeping your squad alive, and you will cruise along. Fall behind on mechanics, or misplay them, and it can quickly become extremely punishing.

It is highly recommended to have some sort of voice communication while tackling the encounter.

Ura requires decently high healing, condition cleanse, and <img class="inline stability"> [Stability](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stability) management, as well as an extreme amount of crowd control. DPS classes that have good personal mobility and cleave damage are highly recommended.

Ura is the only raid boss in the Mount Balrior instance to have a [Legendary Mode](../ura-lcm/overview.html). This variant scales up the health and difficulty of Ura's mechanics to provide the ultimate challenge.

\* Due to Ura regenerating at 1% health, her effective total health is 91,711,432.

** While Ura's defiance technically does not change throughout the encounter, its effective value can become much greater due to <img class="inline titanicresistance"> [Titanic Resistance](mechanics.html#-titanic-resistance).
