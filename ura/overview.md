Ura, the Steamshrieker, is the final boss of the Mount Balrior raid. To fight her, it is necessary to first defeat her two lieutenants, [Greer](../greer/overview.html) and [Decima](../decima/overview.html).

Ura, while a conceptually simple boss, requires an extremely high degree of communication and co-operation, since her unique mechanics need to be cycled through the entire squad. It is highly recommended to use some form of voice communication while tackling her encounter.

Ura has high healing pressure, extremely high crowd control pressure, and benefits greatly from classes that can provide <img class="inline stability"> [Stability](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/Stability), and have good personal mobility and cleave damage.
