Ura, the Steamshrieker, is the final boss of the Mount Balrior raid. To fight her, it is necessary to first defeat her two lieutenants, [Greer](../greer/overview.html) and [Decima](../decima/overview.html).

Ura, while a conceptually simple boss, requires high amounts of coordination and on-the-fly improvisation, facilitated but not superseded by DPS. Stay on top of things as they happen while keeping your squad alive, and you will cruise along. Fall behind on mechanics, and it can quickly become extremely punishing. It is highly recommended to have some sort of voice communication while tackling the encounter.

Ura has decently high healing, condition cleanse and <img class="inline stability"> [Stability](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stability) pressure, requires an extreme amount of crowd control, and benefits greatly from professions that have good personal mobility and cleave damage.

Ura is the only raid boss in the Mount Balrior instance to have a [Legendary Mode](../ura-lcm/overview.html). This variant scales up the health and difficulty of Ura's mechanics to provide the ultimate challenge.

\* Due to Ura regenerating at 1% health, her total health is 91,711,432 and 137,161,289 for CM and LM respectively.

** While Ura's defiance technically does not change throughout the encounter, its effective value can become much greater due to <img class="inline titanicresistance"> [Titanic Resistance](mechanics.html#-titanic-resistance).
