Ura, the Steamshrieker, is the final boss of the Mount Balrior raid. To fight her, it is necessary to first defeat her two lieutenants, [Greer](../greer/overview.html) and [Decima](../decima/overview.html).

Ura, while a conceptually simple boss, requires an extremely high degree of communication and co-operation, since her unique mechanics need to be cycled through the entire squad and involve a decent amount of unpredictability about which player gets targeted by abilities. It is highly recommended to use some form of voice communication while tackling her encounter.

Ura has a decently high healing, condition cleanse and punctually <img class="inline stability"> [Stability](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stability) pressure, requires a high amount of crowd control, and benefits greatly from professions that have good personal mobility and cleave damage.
