All markers referenced in this guide can be set up with the [Commander Markers](https://blishhud.com/modules/?module=Manlaan.CommanderMarkers) module for [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com), using the marker pack provided below.

# Ranged Group Guide
Your responsibilities (excluding basic damage, healing or support as required by your role) consist in:
1. Picking up the ranged [Bloodstone Shard] whenever it's your turn.
2. Using <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] on [Toxic Geysers] to remove <img class='inline hardened'> [Hardened Shell].
2. CC'ing [Toxic Geysers] to kill them.
3. Baiting [Propel] into the proper directions during the first phase.

{: .note}
It is highly recommended (almost mandatory!) to have a [marker pack] that shows you where the [Toxic Geysers] will spawn and in what order.

#### General Information for all Phases
- Picking up the [Bloodstone Shard] right after using <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] (and thus under the effect of <img class='inline saturation'> [Bloodstone Saturation]) will deal massive damage over time. Be aware.
- Standing in [Toxic Geysers] and [Sulfuric Geysers] for too long will afflict you with <img class='inline sulfuricacid'> [Sulfuric Acid]. This is a dangerous condition that must be cleansed soon or you will gain <img class='inline exposed'> [Exposed].
- Check who is before you and after you in the ranged rotation, asking your commander if necessary.
- Set a [personal target](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Call_Target) on the person before you and be aware of where they go so you can pick up the [Bloodstone Shard] after they use it.
- Whenever you <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel], call out the person after you in the rotation and tell them where to pick up the shard.

---

<details class=faq>
<summary>Phase 1</summary>
<div markdown='block'>
{: .note}
> If you are [double dropping], you will have to handle two [Toxic Geysers] every time it's your turn in the rotation. To do this:
> 1. When the person before you in the rotation calls out, move to their geyser, pick up the [Bloodstone Shard], and CC their geyser.
> 2. CC your first geyser soon after it spawns, then wait for the second to spawn.
> 3. Move to your first geyser and <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel].
> 4. Pick up the [Bloodstone Shard], quickly move to your second one and <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] again.

#### 100% - 70%
- If you are first in the rotation, you will start the fight by picking up the ranged [Bloodstone Shard].
- Ura will always begin with [Bubbles]. If you get a bubble, stack with the other targeted person next to the main group.
- After every set of [Bubbles] she will use [Propel]. If you don't have bubbles, try to be the furthest player from the boss to bait it, following the pattern in the image below.
<label class="arena-container">
    <input type="checkbox">
    <img class="zoom center" src="../images/ura/ura_propel_p1.webp" />
</label>
- The ranged rotation starts from [Toxic Geyser] #1 and continues sequentially. If you are [double dropping], you can use the image below for reference.
<label class="arena-container">
    <input type="checkbox">
    <img class="zoom center" src="../images/ura/strategy/ura_double_shard_p1.webp" />
</label>
- Be on stack whenever you are not CCing a geyser or using your [Bloodstone Shard]. Try to provide <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for the [cone attack].
- Try not to <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] just before 70%, or you may not be able to pick up your shard before the boss casts [Return].
</div>
</details>

<details class=faq>
<summary>Phase 2</summary>
<div markdown='block'>
{: .note}
> From this phase onwards it is not necessary to double drop, as the spawn rate of [Toxic Geysers] is halved.

#### 70% - 40%
- The ranged rotation restarts from [Toxic Geyser] #8. The timer will not reset however.
- Be on stack whenever you are not CCing a geyser or using your [Bloodstone Shard]. Try to provide <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for the [jump attack].
- Follow your group to [Titanspawn Geysers]. Try to provide <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for the [Champion Fumaroller]'s attacks.
- Once a [Titanspawn Geyser] is dead, return to the stack and try to recall/remove any pets or clones so that the [Champion Fumaroller] comes to the stack and is cleaved down.
- If you are targeted by the [Arena], run out immediately and place it far from the group.
- If you are targeted by [Sulfuric Geyser], run out immediately and drop it along the edge of the arena. A [marker pack] can show you the safe areas. Prioritize the large area behind <img class='inline xmarker'> and <img class='inline swirl'>.
<img class="center" src="../images/ura/ura_sulfurics.webp" />
</div>
</details>

<details class=faq>
<summary>Phase 3</summary>
<div markdown='block'>

#### 40% - 1%
- The ranged rotation restarts from [Toxic Geyser] #7. The timer will reset, so this geyser will spawn instantly.
- Continue to handle [Titanspawn Geysers] as in the previous phase.
- If your tank calls for backup and you are not doing any mechanics, it is generally your job to provide that backup. To do this, just stand in front of the boss and follow around if it faces a new direction.
- If you get targeted by [Bubbles] at the same time as [Titanspawn Geyser], always try to stack the bubbles on top of the geyser.
</div>
</details>

<details class=faq>
<summary>Phase 4</summary>
<div markdown='block'>

#### 15% (Healed) - 0%
- This phase has all the same mechanics as the previous one.
- You will usually ignore any [Titanspawn Geysers] that are not close to the boss.
- Since there will be many [Champion Fumarollers], try to upkeep constant <img class='inline stability'> [Stability].
- You can ignore most [Toxic Geysers] in this phase, with the exception of #8 and # 11. <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] these and CC them as fast as possible.
- You can reset any other geyser with CC if it starts to become annoying.
</div>
</details>

<img class=divider>

# Melee Group Guide
Your responsibilities (excluding basic damage or support as required by your role) consist in:

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>If you're playing without a melee rotation</summary>
