# Ranged Group Quick Guide
Your responsibilities (excluding basic damage, healing or support as required by your role) consist in:
1. Picking up the ranged [Bloodstone Shard] whenever it's your turn and using <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] on the [Toxic Geysers] that are your duty.
2. CC'ing the [Toxic Geysers] that you <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel].
3. Baiting [Propel] into the proper directions during the first phase.

{: .note}
It is highly recommended (almost mandatory!) to have a [marker pack] that shows you where the [Toxic Geysers] will spawn and in what order.

#### General Information for all Phases
- Picking up the [Bloodstone Shard] right after using one (and thus under the effect of <img class='inline saturation'> [Bloodstone Saturation]) will deal massive damage over time. Be aware.
- Standing in [Toxic Geysers] for too long will afflict you with <img class='inline sulfuricacid'> [Sulfuric Acid]. This is a dangerous condition that must be cleansed soon or you will be <img class='inline exposed'> [Exposed].
- Check who is before you and after you in the ranged rotation, asking your commander if necessary.
- Set a [personal target](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Call_Target) on the person before you and be aware of where they go so you can pick up the [Bloodstone Shard] after they use it.
- Whenever you <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel], call out the person after you in the rotation and tell them where they have to pick up the shard.

<summary>Phase 1</summary>
<div markdown='block'>
{: .note}
> If you are [double dropping](strategy.html#double-sharding-toxic-geysers), you will have to handle two [Toxic Geysers] every time it's your turn in the rotation. To do this:
> 1. CC the first geyser soon after it spawns, then wait for the second to spawn.
> 2. Move to the first geyser and <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel].
> 3. Pick up the [Bloodstone Shard], quickly move to the second one and <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] again.

- If you are first in the rotation, you will start the fight by picking up the ranged shard.
- Start in front of the boss. She will always begin with [Bubbles].
- After every set of [Bubbles] she will use [Propel]. Try to be the furthest one from the boss in order to bait it. Try to follow the pattern in the image below.
- The ranged rotation starts from [Toxic Geyser] #1.
- Be on stack whenever you are not CCing a geyser or using your [Bloodstone Shard]. Try to provide <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for the [cone attack].
- Try not to <img class='inline dispel'> [Dispel] just before 70%, or you may not be able to pick up your shard before the boss casts [Return].

<summary>Phase 2</summary>
<div markdown='block'>
{: .note}
> From this phase onwards it is not necessary to double drop, as the spawn rate of [Toxic Geysers] is halved.

- The ranged rotation restarts from [Toxic Geyser] #7. The timer will not reset however.
- Be on stack whenever you are not CCing a geyser or using your [Bloodstone Shard]. Try to provide <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for the [jump attack].
- Follow your group to kill [Titanspawn Geysers]. Try to provide <img class='inline stability'> [Stability] for the [Champion Fumaroller]'s attacks.
- Once a [Titanspawn Geyser] is dead, return to the stack and try to recall/remove any pets or clones so that the [Champion Fumaroller] comes to the stack and is cleaved down.
- If you are targeted by [Sulfuric Geyser], run out and drop it along the edge of the arena. A [marker pack] can show you the safe areas.
